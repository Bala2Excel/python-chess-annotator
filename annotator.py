Reads a chess game in PGN format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation)
Uses an engine (stockfish) to evaluate the quality of play and add annotations (https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
Prints PGN data with the added annotations

TODO:
  Don't hardcode the engine and PGN inputs - read them from somewhere (args? STDIN?) (check out argparse)
  Try to cut down on the "magic numbers" somehow (dictionary?)
  Time-based analysis limits: instead of specifying a searchdepth, give a time limit on how long to spend analyzing the game
  Always add an analysis of the final position (if the game is not over according to the rules of chess)
  Don't annotate positions where one side has an overwhelming advantage: build extra logic into needs_annotation()
