Reads a chess game in PGN format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation)
Uses an engine (stockfish) to evaluate the quality of play and add annotations (https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
Prints PGN data with the added annotations

TODO:
  Don't hardcode the engine and PGN inputs - read them from somewhere (args? STDIN?) (check out argparse)
  Don't truncate a PV that ends in mate
  Try to cut down on the "magic numbers" somehow (dictionary?)
  Time-based analysis limits: instead of specifying a searchdepth, give a time limit on how long to spend analyzing the game
  Don't annotate positions where one side has an overwhelming advantage: build extra logic into needs_annotation()
